# Healthify

Healthify is a mobile app which
- Compares medicine prices across the
internet and returns the most affordable
ones with OCR
- Figure out the generic medicine name
from the scanned image, and not treat it
as a different name (Ex: Paracetamol and
Crocin, should be treated as the same
medicine)
- Tracks your medicine requirements and
reminds you to take meds
- Alerts you to stock up before your meds
run out
